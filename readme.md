# Kubernetes Developer Workshop

This is a hands-on, technical workshop intended / hack to get comfortable working with Kubernetes, and
deploying and configuring applications. It was forked from Ben Coleman's [workshop](https://github.com/benc-uk/kube-primer) and heavily modified.

This workshop is very much designed for software engineers & developers with little or zero Kubernetes
experience, but wish to get hands on and learn how to deploy and manage applications.

## The Workshop

This workshop will involve us running an app in Minikube.

Sections / modules:

- [‚öíÔ∏è Workshop Pre Requisites](00-pre-reqs/readme.md) - Covering the pre set up and tools that will be
  needed.
- [üêã Containers](01-containers/readme.md) - Run a basic container and explore its internals
- [üèÉ Getting Up and Running](02-running/readme.md) - Start Minikube and run a simple pod on it
- [üöÄ Creating a Deployment](03-deployment/readme.md) - Introducing Services to provide network access
- [üåê Basic Networking](04-network-basics/readme.md) - Introducing Services to provide network access
- [‚ú® Improving The Deployment](05-improvements/readme.md) - Configure resource requests, limits, and probes
- [‚öñÔ∏è Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](06-autoscaler/readme.md) - Set up an autoscaler to handle load
